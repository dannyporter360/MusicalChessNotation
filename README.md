## 🎼 What is Musical Chess Notation?

Musical Chess Notation (MCN) is an experimental chess notation system that combines:
- **Solfege symbols** for ranks (1-8) → Do, Re, Mi, Fa, So, La, Ti, Do
- **Japanese Kana syllables** for files (a-h) → た, ち, つ, て, で, づ, ぢ, だ

The result: Chess moves become **melodic sequences** that can be sung, memorized, and performed as musical drama.

## 🚀 Quick Example

**Standard PGN:** `1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6`

**Musical Notation:** `1. ╱で → ╤で  ↑で → ○で 2. Ⓝ●ぢ → —づ  Ⓝ●̇ち → Λつ`

Each square becomes a **musical-linguistic unit** combining pitch (solfege) with phonetics (kana).

## 🎯 Design Goals

1. **Cognitive Accessibility**: Provide alternate notation for visual-spatial processing challenges
2. **Mnemonic Enhancement**: Leverage auditory memory through melodic patterns
3. **Cultural Integration**: Use familiar musical/linguistic structures (solfege + kana)
4. **Experimental Validity**: Maintain rigorous academic approach to prototype development

## ⚖️ Transparency

MCN is presented as a **humble prototype** based on anecdotal evidence. Benefits for memory and visualization are hypothesized but not empirically validated. The system supplements rather than replaces standard algebraic notation.

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Core Components

- **Notation Converter**: Transforms PGN moves to MCN symbols
- **Board State Tracker**: Maintains game state for disambiguation
- **Audio Synthesizer**: Generates vocal performances of games
- **Performance Engine**: Applies piece-specific vocal characteristics

### Key Features

- Complete 64-square encoding system
- Piece-specific performance voices (legato pawns, staccato knights)
- Real-time PGN to MCN conversion
- Audio synthesis with Japanese kana pronunciation
- Visual board synchronization

## 📚 Getting Started

1. **Read the Language Spec**: Start with `LANGUAGE_SPECIFICATION.md`
2. **Explore Examples**: Check `examples/famous_games.md` for converted classic games
3. **Understand the Logic**: Review `CONVERTER_LOGIC.md` for implementation details
4. **Try the Code**: Examine `core/notation_converter.js` for the main algorithm
